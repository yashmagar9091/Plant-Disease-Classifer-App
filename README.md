# Identification-of-Diseases-in-Plant-leaves-Using-Image-Processing-and-CNN-Approach.
Developed a system to detect plant leaf diseases using image preprocessing, segmentation, and a CNN model. The approach learns visual patterns to classify diseases accurately, enabling early diagnosis and supporting precision agriculture with efficient, automated detection.
This repository is about building an Image classifier CNN with Python on Plant Disease Prediction.
